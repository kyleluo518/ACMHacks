		  <h1>About Us<br></h1>
		  
		  <h2>
			Who are we?
		  </h2>
		  <p>We are students of UCSC who belong to minority groups and share a common goal of expanding people's horizons.
			 We are Nhan Nguyuen, Kyle Huo, Abby Kaur.  </p>
		  <h2>
			Why we built this?
		  </h2>
		  <p>We built this app because we believe that in today's world,
			it's more important than ever to be exposed to different 
			perspectives and ideas. We recognize that people are often
			limited by their own biases and experiences, and may
			not have the opportunity or inclination to seek out new
			viewpoints. Our app provides a unique and accessible way
			for users to engage with an AI-generated persona with a
			specific bias, which can challenge their assumptions and
			broaden their understanding of the world. We believe that
			by fostering open-mindedness and intellectual curiosity,
			we can help people become more informed, empathetic, and 
			engaged members of society.</p>
		  <h2>
			A website made by members of the minority FOR the minority. Spreading encouragement through successes and opportunities.
