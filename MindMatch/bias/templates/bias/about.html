      <h2>
        Who are we?
      </h2>
      <p>We are students of UCSC who belong to minority groups and share a common goal of expanding people's horizons.
         We are Nhan Nguyen, Kyle Luo, Abby Kaur.  </p>
      <h2>
        Why we built this?
      </h2>
      <p>We built this app because we believe that in today's world,
        it's more important than ever to be exposed to different 
        perspectives and ideas. We recognize that people are often
        limited by their own biases and experiences, and may
        not have the opportunity or inclination to seek out new
        viewpoints. Our app provides a unique and accessible way
        for users to engage with an AI-generated persona with a
        specific bias, which can challenge their assumptions and
        broaden their understanding of the world. We believe that
        by fostering open-mindedness and intellectual curiosity,
        we can help people become more informed, empathetic, and 
        engaged members of society.</p>
